**Get All The Tests To Pass! :D**

Your task is to make [all these tests](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/tdd-bookstore/blob/master/test/server_test.js) pass by designing a database schema and writing code within `/server`.

## Setup

```sh
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

## Red... Green... Refactor

```sh
yarn test
# Identify one broken test
# Change the code in /server to make the test pass
# Refactor your code (clean it up)
# Rinse and repeat until all tests pass
```

**WARNING: DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES WITHIN /test**

## Pro Tips

- You must use an express server
- Feel free to `yarn add` any packages you might need
- You should use a database of some kind
- You need to make the HTTP endpoint for resetting your database
- The tests only interact with your code via HTTP requests to your express app
- `yarn test -- --watch` to run your tests after any change
